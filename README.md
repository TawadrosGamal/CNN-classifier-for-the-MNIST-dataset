# CNN-classifier-for-the-MNIST-dataset
this is the CNN classifier for the MNIST dataset with high accuracy 
Modeled with 6 layers :
* A 2D convolutional layer with a 3x3 kernel and 8 filters. Use 'SAME' zero padding and ReLU activation functions.
* A max pooling layer, with a 2x2 window, and default strides.
* A flatten layer, which unrolls the input into a one-dimensional tensor.
* Two dense hidden layers, each with 64 units and ReLU activation functions.
* A dense output layer with 10 units and the softmax activation function.
